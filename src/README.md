# Tempus - Task Management App 

### Aim
To create an app that helps high school students who are struggling to manage their school work and are unsatisfied with the existing apps to manage their tasks. I surveyed high school students to choose the best design and the most demanded features. 

### Features
The main features of the app are Dashboard, Stopwatch/Timer, Calendar, and To-Do list. 

### Landing Page
The landing page is designed to imitate those of existing productivity apps. From the landing page, the user is able to log in or sign up, understand the features of the app, and send an inquiry form. Hover effects make this page interactive and engaging. 

### Dashboard
The dashboard displays the current time, items on the to-do list that are due today, and a daily quote. From the dashboard, the user can also choose a background photo they want to use on the dashboard and to-do list. 

### Timer/Stopwatch
The user can switch between a timer and a stopwatch. The user can either click on large buttons or press the space button to start and stop the timer/stopwatch. 

### To-Do list
When adding a new to-do list item, the user can add a title, description, tags, priority, and due date. They can also specify whether they want to be reminded or not. All to-do list items can be viewed in a list on the left side of the page. On the right side, there is a tag and priority categorization buttons, which the user can press to only show the tasks with specific tags or priorities. They can also see pending reminders at the right bottom corner. When they complete their task, they can click on the checkbox and the task will disappear. The checkbox animation, realized by using pseudo-classes in CSS, makes it engaging and aesthetically pleasing. 

### Calendar
Users can see when their to-do list items are due. Today's date is highlighted in dark green for convenience. The user can see any future or past date. 

### Settings
The user can change their profile picture and choose their favorite alarm sound. They can also change their username and password, and even delete their account.
